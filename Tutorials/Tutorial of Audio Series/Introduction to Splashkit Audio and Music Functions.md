# Introduction to Splashkit Audio and Music Functions
## Introduction
In this comprehensive guide, the first part of audio series(totally 3 parts), we delve into the realm of audio and music functionalities within the Splashkit framework. This tutorial aims to equip you with the skills necessary to enhance your games or applications with immersive audio experiences. We'll explore a variety of functions for loading, playing, and manipulating music tracks in Splashkit.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have the following:
- Basic Programming Knowledge: Familiarity with programming concepts and basic coding practices.
- C++/C# Programming Language: Proficiency in C++ or C# including variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE like Visual Studio Code set up for C++ development.
- Splashkit Framework: Splashkit installed on your system. Installation instructions are available on the Splashkit website.

## Part I: Understanding Splashkitâ€™s Audio System
### Overview:
Splashkit's audio system offers a comprehensive framework for audio processing in game and application development. It enables developers to easily incorporate rich audio experiences into their projects, supporting the loading, playing, and controlling of music and sound effects.

### Key Features:
The primary audio functionalities of the system include:
- Playback Control: Play, pause, resume, and stop music.
- Volume Adjustment: Adjust the volume level of audio files.
- Track Management: Handle the loading and playback of multiple audio tracks.

### Supported Formats:
Splashkit supports various common audio file formats, including but not limited to MP3 and WAV.

### Format Considerations:
- MP3: Suitable for longer music files with smaller file sizes but may compromise some sound quality.
- WAV: Provides higher sound quality, ideal for sound effects and short music clips, but with larger file sizes.

### Basic Implementation:
Integrating audio into games or applications involves loading and playing audio files. Splashkit offers intuitive functions to handle these tasks.

### Resource Management:
Proper management of audio resources is crucial to ensure the performance and responsiveness of the application. Only load the audio files that are currently needed and release them when they are no longer required.

A basic code example for loading and playing music:
```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main() {
    open_window("Audio Example", 800, 600);
    music track = load_music("my_music", "background.mp3");

    play_music(track);

    // Main game loop
    while (!window_close_requested("Audio Example")) {
        process_events();
        clear_screen(COLOR_WHITE);
        refresh_screen();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Use Case Scenarios:
- Background Music Playback: Loop background music in the game's main menu or during levels.
- Sound Effect Triggering: Play sound effects when the player performs specific actions, such as jumping or shooting.

## Part II: Loading and Playing Music
### Loading Music from Files
- Using **load_music**: 
```cpp
music my_music = load_music("game_background", "background_music.mp3");
```
- Supported Audio Formats: 
Splashkit supports various audio formats including MP3 and WAV. Choosing the right format depends on your needs, such as balancing sound quality with file size.
- Best Practices: 
When organizing audio resources, it's recommended to place audio files in a dedicated audio directory within your project for ease of management and referencing.

### Retrieving Music File Names and Names by Index
- Using **music_filename** and **music_name**: 
```cpp
string file_name = music_filename(my_music);
string track_name = music_name("game_background");
```
- Using Playback Functions: 
The **play_music** function is used to start playing a music track. You can specify whether to loop the track and the initial volume level.
```cpp
music my_music = load_music("my_background_music", "background_music.mp3");
play_music(my_music, -1, 0.5); // -1 for looping indefinitely, 0.5 for volume level
```

The pause_music function is used to pause the currently playing music. It doesn't require additional parameters.
```cpp
pause_music();
```

If the music has been paused, resume_music can be used to continue playback.
```cpp
resume_music();
```

The stop_music function stops the currently playing music. After calling this function, if you want to play the music again, you need to call play_music anew.
```cpp
stop_music();
```
These functions are typically called in the game logic according to different events and conditions, such as playing music at the start of a game or pausing the music when the user pauses the game. With these functions, you can implement flexible audio control in your games or applications.

- Real-world Scenarios: 
Suppose your game has a pause feature, and you want to automatically pause the background music when the game is paused. Here is a simple example:
```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

// Assume this is your game loop or similar function
void game_loop()
{
    bool game_paused = false; // A variable to track whether the game is paused
    music background_music = load_music("background", "background.mp3");

    // Start playing the background music
    play_music(background_music, -1, 0.5); // -1 for looping indefinitely, 0.5 is the volume

    while (not quit_requested())
    {
        // Process game events
        process_events();

        // Check if the game is paused
        if (key_typed(SPACE_KEY)) // Assuming the space key is used to pause and resume the game
        {
            game_paused = !game_paused; // Toggle the game pause state

            if (game_paused)
            {
                // Pause the music
                pause_music();
            }
            else
            {
                // Resume the music
                resume_music();
            }
        }

        // Game update and render code...

        refresh_screen();
    }
}
```
Here is an example showing how to check if the music is playing and respond based on the playback status:
```cpp
void check_music_status()
{
    // Check if music is currently playing
    if (music_playing())
    {
        // If music is playing, perform some actions
        // For example, you could display a music playing icon on the game's HUD
    }
    else
    {
        // If music is not playing, perform other actions
        // For example, you could prompt the user that the music is paused
    }
}
```

## Part III: Controlling Music Volume
### Adjusting and Manipulating Music Volume
- Using **music_volume**: 
The **music_volume** function allows you to adjust the volume of music during playback. This can be particularly useful for adapting to user preferences or specific game scenarios. For example:
```cpp
music my_music = load_music("game_music", "background.mp3");
play_music(my_music);

// Adjust volume to 50%
music_volume(my_music, 0.5);
```
- Enhancing User Experience: 
Proper volume control is essential for creating an enjoyable user experience. Adjusting volume levels can help in avoiding audio elements that are too loud or too soft in relation to the game's overall audio mix.

### Techniques for Fading Music In and Out for Seamless Audio Transitions
- Fading Music In: 
Use the **fade_music_in** function to smoothly transition music from silence to a desired volume level, enhancing the start of a new scene or level. For example:
```cpp
// Fade in music over 3 seconds
fade_music_in(my_music, 3, 0.75); // 0.75 is the target volume
```
- Practical Examples: 
Fading techniques are ideal for scenarios like changing levels in a game or transitioning between different states (e.g., from a menu screen to the game itself). They help avoid abrupt changes in audio, which can be jarring for players.
```cpp
if (changing_levels) {
    fade_music_out(current_level_music, 2);
    fade_music_in(next_level_music, 2, 1.0); // 1.0 for full volume
}
```
