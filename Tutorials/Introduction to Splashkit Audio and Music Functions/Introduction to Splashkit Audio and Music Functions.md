# Introduction to Splashkit Audio and Music Functions
## Introduction
This tutorial aims to equip you with the skills necessary to enhance your games or applications with immersive audio experiences. We'll explore a variety of functions for loading, playing, and manipulating music tracks in Splashkit.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.
- Proficiency in C++ or C#.
- A configured IDE for C++ or C# development, like Visual Studio Code.
- SplashKit framework installed. Refer to the [SplashKit installation guide](https://splashkit.io/installation/).

## Detailed Examples of Audio Functions
- **Loading Music from Files**
```cpp
// Loading music asynchronously to prevent UI blocking
async music load_music_async(string name, string filename) {
    return load_music(name, filename);
}

music background_music = load_music_async("background", "path/to/background.mp3");
```

- **Playing and Controlling Music Playback**
Play music with looping and specified volume:
```cpp
play_music(background_music, true, 0.5); // Loop indefinitely at 50% volume
```

Pause and resume music:
```cpp
// To pause the music
pause_music();

// Code to check game state or user action

// To resume the music
resume_music();
```

Stop music and unload it from memory:
```cpp
stop_music(background_music);
free_music(background_music); // Always remember to free resources
```
- **Advanced Playback Control**
Conditional playback based on game events, such as a victory or loss:
```cpp
if (player_wins) {
    play_music(victory_music, false, 0.75); // Play once at 75% volume
} else if (player_loses) {
    play_music(defeat_music, false, 0.75); // Play once at 75% volume
}
```

- **Dynamic Volume Adjustment**
Adjusting music volume in real-time, perhaps in response to an in-game event or user settings:
```cpp
// Assuming volume is a float that ranges from 0.0 (mute) to 1.0 (max)
float volume = user_settings.music_volume;
music_volume(background_music, volume);
```

- **Fading Music In and Out**
Smooth transitions using fading effects for scene changes:
```cpp
// Fade out current music over 2 seconds
fade_music_out(current_music, 2000);

// Wait for the fade to complete
delay(2000);

// Load the next track
music next_track = load_music("next_scene_music", "next_scene.mp3");

// Fade in next music over 3 seconds to 80% volume
fade_music_in(next_track, 3000, 0.8);
```

- **Managing Game State Audio**
```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

void manage_game_audio(game_state state) {
    static music current_music = load_music("game_music", "game_background.mp3");

    switch (state) {
        case GAME_START:
            play_music(current_music, true, 0.5);
            break;
        case GAME_PAUSE:
            pause_music();
            break;
        case GAME_RESUME:
            resume_music();
            break;
        case GAME_OVER:
            fade_music_out(current_music, 1000);
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    open_window("SplashKit Audio Example", 800, 600);

    // Initial game state
    game_state state = GAME_START;
    manage_game_audio(state);

    // Main game loop
    while (!window_close_requested()) {
        process_events();

        if (key_typed(SPACE_KEY)) {
            // Toggle pause and resume with space key
            state = (state == GAME_PAUSE) ? GAME_RESUME : GAME_PAUSE;
            manage_game_audio(state);
        }

        clear_screen(COLOR_WHITE);
        refresh_screen(60);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
