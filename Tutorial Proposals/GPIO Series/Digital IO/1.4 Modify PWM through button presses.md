title: 1.4 Modify PWM through button presses
---

## Introduction

This tutorial delves into the practical application of combining digital inputs with Pulse Width
Modulation (PWM) outputs. The tutorial intends to incrementally increase an LED's brightness with
each button press. Through this, the reader gains further hands-on experience with digital signal
processing and event-driven programming. This tutorial serves as a progression from basic GPIO tasks
to more complex interactions between inputs and outputs.
