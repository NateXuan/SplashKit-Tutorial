title: 1.1 Blink an LED
---

## Introduction

This tutorial is designed for beginners who are interested in learning how to interact with the
physical world using the Raspberry Pi. The reader learns how to wire an LED to the Raspberry Pi
and control it to blink at regular intervals. This project is a foundational exercise in
understanding General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of electronics.
- Raspberry Pi setup with SplashKit installed.
- Basic programming knowledge in C++.
- Equipment: 1 Breadboard, 1 LED, 1 200-300Î© Resistor, 2 DuPont Jumpers (M-F)

## Functions Used

- [Raspi Init](https://splashkit.io/api/raspberry/#raspi-init)
- [Raspi Set Mode](https://splashkit.io/api/raspberry/#raspi-set-mode)
- [Raspi Write](https://splashkit.io/api/raspberry/#raspi-write)
- [Raspi Cleanup](https://splashkit.io/api/raspberry/#raspi-cleanup)

## Table of Contents

1. **Setting up Raspberry Pi**

   - Ensure daemon is running

2. **Building the Circuit**

   - Components Needed
   - Component Explanations
   - Circuit Diagram and Assembly

3. **Programming the Blink**
   - Initialising pins
   - Writing the Blink Program
   - Cleaning Up on Exit

## Tutorial Details

### Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is structured to guide through each step of the process. It begins from setting
up/ensuring the daemon is running for GPIO control and ensuring the proper initialisation of the
Raspberry Pi. Then we build the electronic circuit and write the program to blink the LED. The
tutorial ends with an emphasis on the importance of the pin cleanup upon exit.

The level of difficulty is beginner, and it is aimed at readers who are new to electronics and
programming.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

- Understand the basics of Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and how they work.
- Know how to set up a circuit with an LED.
- Be able to control an LED using the SplashKit library.
- Have a foundational knowledge that can be built upon for more complex projects involving Raspberry
  Pi and external hardware.

## Conclusion

Controlling an LED through GPIO pins is a crucial first step into the world of electronics and
programming. This tutorial is intended to provide the knowledge to create a basic circuit and
control it with code. The reader must develop this skill as it forms the basis for more complex
projects. The principles covered in this tutorial serves as a valuable foundation to any project
involving hardware control. It's aim is to introduce the reader to the vast possibilities GPIO pins
offer, and to encourage further experimentation.
