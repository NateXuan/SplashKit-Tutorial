title: 1.3 Control LED Brightness through PWM
---

## Introduction

Building on the basics, this tutorial explores how to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control
the brightness of an LED. PWM is a technique in which the duty cycle and frequency of a signal can
be varied. This variation is used to achieve precise control over the brightness of an LED. This
guide has a focus on using PWM to control the brightness of an LED. It provides a hands-on approach
to understanding and applying PWM in the readers projects.

## Tutorial Details

This tutorial is intended for intermediate learners who have basic knowledge of reading and writing
GPIO pins. The focus of the tutorial is on practical implementation and application of PWM in
controlling external hardware. It is an extension to the LED Blinking tutorial, in which the ability
to control the hardware through software is demonstrated.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

- Reader understands what PWM is and how it can be used to control brightness of an LED.
- Know how to set up a GPIO pin for PWM output.
- Be able to adjust the brightness of an LED through modifying PWM duty cycle and frequency, and
  control the granularity of the PWM output through setting the PWM range.
- Develop the skills to implement PWM in the readers own projects, to open up possibilities for more
  complex control of hardware.

## Conclusion

PWM is a powerful technique which we can use to control the brightness of LEDs, or the speed of
motors and much more. By developing skills in PWM the reader gains more control over their
electronics projects. The reader also develops a deeper understanding of how digital signals can be
used to simulate analog behaviour. This tutorial aims to equip the reader with the knowledge and
skills to implement PWM in their own projects. As the reader becomes more comfortable with PWM, it
enables the creation of more sophisticated and interactive projects.
